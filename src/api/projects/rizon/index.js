I saw a calendar with beautiful illustrations of sun and moon phases when I remembered how frustrating it was finding the best time to take photos outdoors. There were a few online tools, but they were all clunky and displayed too much information. I wanted to change that, taking inspiration from the calendar I\'d seen in New York. I did some sketches on the flight home and started designing the next day.'
